=================

Despite the humble appearance, this project serves as a milestone for a monumental breakthrough in terms of understanding
how backbone works. The data is populated via a local server built by @masondesu ( https://github.com/masondesu/tiny-server ),
so unless you do a little tinkering and uncomment the data I've hardcoded into the site, there's not too much to see here
on the gh-pages branch. I've left an early commit with the hardcoded information in there so you can get an idea of the
core functionality.

Check out branch mongo to see what's going on behind the scenes with the tinyserver up and running.
